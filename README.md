## üöÄ Quick Start

Choose your preferred implementation:

- **React and NextJS with Hardhat or Foundry**
- **Vue and NuxtJS with Hardhat or Foundry**

### üì¶ Installation

Open up your terminal (or command prompt) and type the following command:

```sh
npx create-edu-dapp <your-dapp-name>

# Select Hardhat or Foundry Option

# cd into the directory
cd <your-dapp-name>
```

**_Note: If you have used the npx command then you don't have to install manually in any directory._**

# Hardhat Setup

## üìú Smart Contracts

All smart contracts are located inside the `backend` aka `hardhat` folder, which can be found in the root directory. To get started, first install the necessary dependencies by running:

```sh
# change directory into the backend folder
cd backend

npm install
```

### üîë Private Key

Ensure you create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. Then paste your [Metamask private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key) in `.env` with the variable name `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` as follows:

```sh
ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x734...
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compile

Now, you can write your contracts in `./contracts/` directory, replace `Greeter.sol` with `<your-contracts>.sol` file.

```sh
# For compiling the smart contracts
npx hardhat compile
```

After successful compilation, the artifacts directory will be created in `./src` with a JSON `/contracts/<your-contracts>.sol/<your-contracts>.json` containing ABI and Bytecode of your compiled smart contracts.

### üß™ Test

To write tests, go to `./test` directory and create `<your-contracts>.ts`, you can test your smart contracts using the following command.

```sh
# For testing the smart contracts
npx hardhat test
```

### ‚õìÔ∏è Deploy

Before deploying the smart contracts, ensure that you have added the [`Open Campus Codex`](https://devdocs.opencampus.xyz/getting-started) to your MetaMask wallet and that it has sufficient funds. If you do not have testnet $EDU on Open Campus Codex, please follow this [faucets guide](https://devdocs.opencampus.xyz/build/faucet).

Also, make changes in `./scripts/deploy.ts` (replace the greeter contract name with `<your-contract-name>`).

For deploying the smart contracts to `open campus codex` network, type the following command:

```sh
# For deploying the smart contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network educhain-testnet
```

```sh
<your-contract> deployed to: 0x...
```

**Copy and paste the generated contract JSON ABI folder `contracts` inside the `backend/src/contracts` directory to the `/frontend/` directory.**

**Copy and paste the deployed contract address in the frontend page directory. For example, if the deployed contract is `Greeter.sol`, then you have to paste the address in `frontend/app/(dapps)/simple-greeting-dapp/page.tsx`.**

### ‚úÖ Verify

To verify the deployed smart contract on `Open Campus Codex`, execute the following command:

```sh
# For verifying the smart contracts
npx hardhat verify --network educhain-testnet <deployed-contract-address>
```

# Foundry Setup

## üìú Smart Contracts

All smart contracts are located inside the `backend` aka `foundry` folder, which can be found in the root directory.

```sh
# change directory into the backend folder
cd backend
```

### üîë Private Key

Ensure you create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. Then paste your [Metamask private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key) in `.env` with the variable name `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` as follows:

```sh
ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x734...
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compile

Now, you can write your contracts in `./src/` directory, replace `Greeter.sol` with `<your-contracts>.sol` file.

```sh
# For compiling the smart contracts
forge compile
```

After successful compilation, the artifacts directory will be created in `./out` with a JSON `/<your-contract>/<your-contracts>.json` containing ABI and Bytecode of your compiled smart contracts.

### üß™ Test

To write tests, go to `./test` directory and create `<your-contracts>.t.sol`, you can test your smart contracts using the following command.

```sh
# For testing the smart contracts
forge test
```

### ‚õìÔ∏è Deploy

Before deploying the smart contracts, ensure that you have added the [`Open Campus Codex`](https://devdocs.opencampus.xyz/getting-started) to your MetaMask wallet and that it has sufficient funds. If you do not have testnet $EDU on Open Campus Codex, please follow this [faucets guide](https://devdocs.opencampus.xyz/build/faucet).

Also, make changes in `./script/DeployGreeter.s.sol` (replace the deploy greeter contract name with `<your-contract-name>`).

For deploying the smart contracts to `open campus codex` network, type the following command:

```sh
# For deploying the smart contracts
forge script script/DeployGreeter.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url https://rpc.open-campus-codex.gelato.digital/ --gas-limit 30000000 --with-gas-price 5gwei --skip-simulation
```

```sh
<your-contract> deployed to: 0x...
```

**Copy and paste the generated contract JSON ABI folder `Greeter.sol` inside the `backend/out/` directory to the `/frontend/contracts/` directory.**

**Copy and paste the deployed contract address in the frontend page directory. For example, if the deployed contract is `Greeter.sol`, then you have to paste the address in `frontend/app/(dapps)/simple-greeting-dapp/page.tsx`.**

### ‚úÖ Verify

To verify the deployed smart contract on `Open Campus Codex`, execute the following command:

```sh
# For verifying the smart contracts
forge verify-contract \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.open-campus-codex.gelato.digital \
  --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url 'https://edu-chain-testnet.blockscout.com/api/' \
  <deployed-contract-address> \
  [contractFile]:[contractName]
```

## Next.js Client

Start the Next.js app by running the following command in the `frontend` directory:

```sh
# Change directory into the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
